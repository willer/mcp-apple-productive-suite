Please take a look at this codebase. We have a project to work through!

. Project Goals
Provide an MCP-based server that lets an AI (like Claude or another agent) read/write/edit Apple Reminders, Notes, and Calendars via tool calls.
Extend the server capabilities to:
Query upcoming events and potential scheduling conflicts in Apple Calendar.
Prioritize, categorize, and mark Apple Reminders as completed.
Search for and manage Apple Notes.
Provide a flexible foundation that is easy to maintain (KISS and SOLID), avoiding excessive complexity (YAGNI).

2. Overview of the Needed Extensions
Add “read” or “search” operations for each of the existing resource types:
Notes: ability to find notes by keyword or date created.
Reminders: ability to list inbox reminders, filter them by priority, flag status, or completion state.
Calendar: supply relevant day or week summaries, detect potential overlapping events, etc.
Update existing “create” operations to include the ability to edit or finalize existing items. For example:
Mark a Reminder as completed.
Change priorities or flagged status in Reminders.
Update titles, times, and notes in Calendar events.
Update the body or title of existing Notes.
Implement summary or recommendation endpoints:
A method for the AI to get a daily agenda or alert about urgent tasks.
A function to highlight the next best action based on priority and due dates in Reminders.
---
3. Suggested Architectural Additions
► New Data Access Classes for “read” operations
Example “RemindersService” class to encapsulate listing, filtering, and marking Reminders completed.
Example “NotesService” class to encapsulate searching or retrieving existing Notes by name or search string.
Example “CalendarService” class to read your calendar events over a configurable date range and detect conflicts.
► Extended “Server” Tools
Tools are the official entry point: for instance, “list_reminders,” “complete_reminder,” “search_notes,” or “list_events_for_day.”
Keep each tool’s input schema concise yet strongly typed. Avoid big “kwargs”-style objects in Python or random untyped arguments in TypeScript.
► Additional Unit Tests
Ensure each new function or class has a minimal set of unit tests to confirm correct behavior of the JXA calls, input validation, and so on.
Gradually add coverage for negative test cases (e.g., no matching note found).

4. Implementation Steps
Below is a rough sequence for the AI developer to follow:
### Reading Reminders
Add a new tool “list_reminders” that returns reminders in the inbox or by optional criteria (e.g., flagged, overdue, high priority).
Internally, create a “RemindersService” class that wraps the JXA logic. For example, a “listReminders(filterOptions)” method that returns typed “Reminder[]” objects.
### Updating Reminders
Extend the “RemindersService” class with methods like “completeReminder(reminderId),” “flagReminder(reminderId),” and “updateReminderPriority(reminderId, priority).”
Expose each of these as new tools. They can share a single “update_reminder” tool with an input schema specifying which fields to update (e.g., completionState, flagged, priority).
### Searching Notes
Add a “search_notes” tool that returns a list of notes matching a search keyword.
In “NotesService,” implement a “searchNotes(query)” method to run the JXA script that filters note names/bodies for the given query.
### Calendar Reading & Conflict Detection
Add a “list_events_for_day” or “get_calendar_overview” tool, returning events for a given date or range.
Include logic to detect overlapping date ranges. Potentially expose a “find_calendar_conflicts” tool.
### Status Summaries & Recommendations
Implement a tool, e.g., “get_daily_agenda,” that:
Lists your day’s events and reminders.
Highlights urgent or overdue items.
This can be started simply (KISS) and iterated on later.
### Additional Housekeeping
Provide example usage or test calls in the README, showing how to integrate with the new tools.
Write brief unit tests where possible (using a testing framework like Jest or similar) to validate correctness.

5. Best Practices & Guidelines
Use Classes for Encapsulation
Each domain (Notes, Reminders, Calendar) can define classes or modules that handle reading and writing data.
Keep global references to “Application(‘Reminders’)” or “Application(‘Notes’)” encapsulated inside these service classes.
Strong Typing and Lean Schemas
In TypeScript, define separate type interfaces for input schemas versus data objects.
Keep the shape of each request simple and explicit. For example, “completeReminder” takes “reminderId” as a string, with no extra/untyped fields.
Keep It Simple and Incremental (YAGNI, KISS)
Don’t add too many advanced features or complex subcommands ahead of time. Start small and add more after verifying core functionality.
Reuse existing server patterns: each new tool or handler is added through “server.setRequestHandler(schema, handlerFunction).”
Validate Inputs & Handle Errors
Throw or return user-friendly error messages if the required arguments aren’t present or are invalid (e.g., blank strings).
Test Critical Flows
Testing schedule overlap detection, marking reminders as completed, and searching notes will help avoid subtle logic bugs.

6. Next Steps
• Confirm the final priority of new features (e.g., reading reminders vs. searching notes) based on your immediate needs.
• Begin with the “list_reminders” and “complete_reminder” features to pave the way for broader task management.
• Update documentation in README to provide usage examples for each new tool.
